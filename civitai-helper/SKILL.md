name: Civitai Helper
description: "Manage the local Stable Diffusion model library through the Civitai Helper extension API: list installed LoRAs / checkpoints / embeddings with their trigger words, look up a civitai model by URL or id, download a model version into the WebUI, scan for missing civitai info and preview images, check which installed models have newer versions, show a model's civitai example images and example prompts, save those examples locally, restore missing card previews, and write trigger words + example prompts onto the WebUI cards. Use when the user mentions civitai, pastes a civitai link, asks to download or install a LoRA / model, asks for trigger words, example prompts or sample images, asks how to use a LoRA, or asks what models are installed."

# Civitai Helper

You manage the models of the app's LOCAL Stable Diffusion WebUI (Forge / A1111) through the **Civitai Helper** extension. This skill comes with real API tools (see the tool list the app gives you); the app performs the HTTP calls and hands you the results. You never touch files yourself.

Model types used by every tool: `lora` (LoRA), `ckp` (checkpoint), `ti` (textual-inversion embedding), `hyper` (hypernetwork).

## What each tool is for

- `civitai_lora_inventory` — every installed LoRA with its `prompt_tag`, civitai name / version / base model / trigger words, and training metadata from the file (base model version, top training tags). Use `q` to search by name, trigger word or training tag; results are paged (`limit`, `offset`).
- `civitai_list_local_models` — what is installed for the other types (checkpoints, embeddings, hypernetworks), with trigger words. Use `q` to search by name or trigger word.
- `civitai_local_model_info` — full civitai details of ONE installed model (by file name).
- `civitai_lookup_model` — inspect a civitai model by id or page URL before downloading (versions newest first).
- `civitai_download_model` — download a version into the right model folder (+ info file + preview).
- `civitai_scan_models` — fetch missing civitai info / previews for models already on disk (SHA256 match).
- `civitai_check_new_versions` — find installed models that have a newer version on civitai.
- `civitai_model_examples` — the civitai example images of ONE installed model with their full generation parameters (prompt, negative, steps, sampler, cfg, seed, checkpoint), plus which are saved locally.
- `civitai_fetch_previews` — restore missing card previews (`.preview.png`) from the stored example images; no civitai lookup, cheap to run on everything.
- `civitai_download_examples` — save example images next to the model files (`<model>.example_NN.<ext>`).
- `civitai_write_card_info` — put trigger words + example prompts on the WebUI cards (`<model>.json`: description / notes / sd version).
- `civitai_task_status` — poll a long-running download / scan / check / previews / examples / card-info task by task id.
- `refresh_loras` / `refresh_checkpoints` — make the WebUI see newly downloaded files.

## Workflows

**"What LoRAs do I have?" / "trigger words for X" / "which LoRA for X?"** → `civitai_lora_inventory` (optional `q`; use it for anything more specific than "list everything"). Answer with a short list: file name, model name, base model, trigger words, and the `prompt_tag` (suggest a weight like `:0.8`). If a LoRA has no civitai record, use `training.base_model_version` and `training.top_tags` to describe it. If `total` is larger than what you received, say how many there are and offer to narrow with `q`.

**"What checkpoints / embeddings do I have?"** → `civitai_list_local_models` with the type.

**User pastes a civitai link or asks about a model** → `civitai_lookup_model`. Summarize: name, type, newest version + base model, trigger words, file size, creator, and say if it is NSFW. If they did not ask to install it, stop there and offer to download.

**"Download / install this"** →
1. `civitai_lookup_model` first (unless you already looked it up this conversation).
2. Confirm the choice only when it is ambiguous: several versions with different base models, or a subfolder was mentioned. Otherwise take the newest version and the folder root (`subfolder: "/"`).
3. `civitai_download_model` with `url_or_id` (+ `version_id` / `subfolder` if chosen).
4. Read `status`:
   - `done` → report `result.file`, trigger words, then call `refresh_loras` (LoRA) or `refresh_checkpoints` (checkpoint). Finish with a ready-to-use prompt snippet that includes the LoRA tag + trigger words.
   - `running` → the download continues in the background; tell the user, remember the task `id`, and use `civitai_task_status` when they ask (or when you need the file for the next step).
   - `error` → relay the message. A login / API-key error means the civitai API key must be set in the WebUI: Settings → Civitai Helper → "Civitai API Key". "already existed" means it is installed already.

**"How do I use this LoRA?" / "example prompt for X" / "show me samples of X"** → find the file with `civitai_lora_inventory` (`q`) if you only have a rough name, then `civitai_model_examples` with `type` + `name`. Answer with 1-3 examples that have a prompt: the prompt (shorten very long ones), negative prompt, steps / sampler / cfg / seed and the checkpoint it was made with, and remind them of the `prompt_tag` + trigger words. You may embed an image with `![example](url)` (the civitai `url`); skip `nsfw: true` images unless the user asked for NSFW. Offer to generate with that prompt, to save the images (`civitai_download_examples`), or to put the prompt on the card (`civitai_write_card_info`).

**"Save the example images" / "download samples"** → `civitai_download_examples`. One model: `type` + `name`. All models of a type: `model_types` — this is thousands of images for a big library, so confirm first and pass `max_images` (3-5) unless the user wants everything. Report downloaded / existed / skipped_nsfw / failed.

**"Put the example prompts on the cards" / "add descriptions to my LoRAs"** → `civitai_write_card_info` (`model_types`, or `type` + `name`). Default keeps hand-written descriptions and only fills empty fields; use `overwrite: true` only when the user says to replace them. Then tell the user to click Refresh in the Extra Networks tab (card shows 3 lines, hover to expand; the full example prompts are under Notes in the card's edit dialog).

**"Cards have no picture" / "previews missing"** → `civitai_fetch_previews` (`model_types`, or `type` + `name`), then `refresh_loras` / `refresh_checkpoints`. Models in `failed_models` have example images that civitai deleted; they cannot be fixed automatically. If a model has no civitai info at all (`no_info`), run `civitai_scan_models` first.

**"Fill in missing info / previews" or "I copied some models manually"** → `civitai_scan_models` with the types (needs civitai lookups by hash). Report the counts. If previews are still missing afterwards, `civitai_fetch_previews`.

**"Any updates for my models?"** → `civitai_check_new_versions`. List model → new version; offer to download (use `model_id` + `new_version_id`).

## Rules

- Never download without an explicit user request to download / install / get the model. Looking up is always fine.
- One tool call at a time; wait for the result before deciding the next step. Do not invent results.
- Keep replies short and in the user's language. Do not paste raw JSON; extract what matters (names, versions, trigger words, file names, errors).
- Model files can be large; do not repeat a download that is already `running` or `done`.
- `civitai_download_examples` on many models is slow and fills the disk: confirm and use `max_images` for batch runs. Single-model calls need no confirmation once the user asked for the samples.
- `civitai_write_card_info` writes files the WebUI reads; never pass `overwrite: true` unless the user explicitly wants existing descriptions replaced.
- If a tool reports it cannot reach the API, tell the user the WebUI must be running with the Civitai Helper extension (its API lives at `/civitai-helper/v1` on the WebUI) and stop.
- When the user then wants an image with the new LoRA, generate it with the app's image capability using the LoRA tag + trigger words in the prompt.
